# ~EPUB to .EPUB

A Python script to convert .epub folders into archives

This is needed when you're extracting .epub files from Apple Books on macOS, in order to work with these files in tools such as Calibre or export them into services such as Kindle or Google Play Books.

Download the folder, adjust 'USERNAME' variable, check folder paths and launch the script.py file.

Simple stuff.
